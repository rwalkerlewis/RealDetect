# Regional Velocity Model Configuration
# SeisProc - User-defined 1D velocity models for geographic regions
#
# Each section defines a velocity model and its geographic bounds.
# The model with the highest priority that contains the event location is used.
#
# Bounds types:
#   box:     min_lat,max_lat,min_lon,max_lon
#   circle:  center_lat,center_lon,radius_km
#   polygon: lat1,lon1;lat2,lon2;lat3,lon3;...
#
# Priority: higher values = checked first (default: 0)

# Default global model (used when no regional model matches)
